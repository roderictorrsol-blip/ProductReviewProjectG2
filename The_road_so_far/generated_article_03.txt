## Conclusion
If you want the safest choice in each category, start with the **Top pick**. If you have a specific preference (budget, comfort, durability, etc.), check the **Also great** and **Consider if** options—those usually trade one strength for another.

## Methodology (brief)
- Categories come from your clustering/categories pipeline.
- “Top products” are ranked using a weighted score that combines average sentiment with review volume.
- The written summaries use only the supplied evidence snippets; they may not cover every edge case.
